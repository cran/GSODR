\title{Download Latest Station List Information and Update GSODR's Internal Database}
\usage{
update_station_list()
}
\description{
This function downloads the latest station list (isd-history.csv) from the
NCEI FTP server and updates the data distributed with \pkg{GSODR} to the
latest stations available.  These data provide unique identifiers, country,
state (if in US), latitude, longitude, elevation and when weather
observations begin and end.  Stations with invalid latitude and longitude
values will not be included.
}
\details{
Care should be taken when using this function if reproducibility is necessary
as different machines with the same version of \pkg{GSODR} can end up with
different versions of the isd_history.csv file internally.

There is no need to use this unless you know that a station exists in the
GSODR data that is not available in the self-contained database.

To directly access these data, use: \cr
\code{load(system.file("extdata", "isd_history.rda", package = "GSODR"))}
}
