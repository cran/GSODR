\title{Download and return a data frame of \acronym{GSOD} weather station data inventories}
\usage{
get_inventory()
}
\value{
A \code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} object of station inventories
}
\description{
The \acronym{NCEI} maintains a document,
\url{https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-inventory.txt}, which lists
the number of weather observations by station-year-month from the beginning
of the stations' records.  This function retrieves that document and prints
an information header displaying the last update time with a data frame of
the inventory information for each station-year-month.
}
\note{
The \acronym{GSOD} data, which are downloaded and manipulated by
\pkg{GSODR}, stipulate that the following notice should be given.
\dQuote{The following data and products may have conditions placed on their
international commercial use.  They can be used within the U.S. or for non-
