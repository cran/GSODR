\title{Clean, Reformat and Generate New Variables From GSOD Weather Data}
\usage{
reformat_GSOD(dsn = NULL, file_list = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dsn}{User supplied file path to location of station file data on
local disk for reformatting.}

\item{file_list}{User supplied list of files of station data on local disk for
reformatting.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} object of weather data or a comma-separated value
(CSV) or GeoPackage (GPKG) file saved to local disk.
}
\description{
This function automates cleaning and reformatting of GSOD,
\url{https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod},
station files in "WMO-WBAN-YYYY.op.gz" format that have been downloaded from
the United States National Climatic Data Center's (NCDC) FTP server.
}
\details{
For automated downloading and processing see the \code{\link{get_GSOD}}
function which provides expanded functionality for automatically downloading
and expanding annual GSOD files and cleaning station files.

This function reformats the data into a more usable form and calculates three
new variables; Saturation Vapor Pressure (ES) â€“ Actual Vapor Pressure (EA) and
relative humidity (RH). All units are converted to International System of
Units (SI), e.g., Fahrenheit to Celsius and inches to millimetres. Alternative
elevation measurements are supplied for missing values or values found to be
questionable based on the Consultative Group for International Agricultural
Research's Consortium for Spatial Information group's (CGIAR-CSI) Shuttle
Radar Topography Mission 90 metre (SRTM 90m) digital elevation data based on
NASA's original SRTM 90m data.


Data summarise each year by station, which include vapour pressure and
relative humidity variables calculated from existing data in GSOD.

All missing values in resulting files are represented as NA regardless of
which field they occur in.

Only station files in .op.gz file format are supported by this function. If
you have downloaded the full annual "gsod_YYYY.tar" file you will need to
extract the individual station files first to use this function.

The data returned either in a data.frame object that includes the following
fields:
\describe{
\item{STNID}{Station number (WMO/DATSAV3 number) for the location}
\item{WBAN}{Number where applicable--this is the historical "Weather Bureau
Air Force Navy" number - with WBAN being the acronym}
\item{STN_NAME}{Unique text identifier}
\item{CTRY}{Country in which the station is located}
\item{LAT}{Latitude. *Station dropped in cases where values are < -90 or
> 90 degrees or Lat = 0 and Lon = 0* (WGS84)}
\item{LON}{Longitude. *Station dropped in cases where values are < -180 or
> 180 degrees or Lat = 0 and Lon = 0* (WGS84)}
\item{ELEV_M}{Elevation in metres}
\item{ELEV_M_SRTM_90m}{Elevation in metres corrected for possible errors,
derived from the CGIAR-CSI SRTM 90m database (Jarvis et al. 2008)}
\item{YEARMODA}{Date in YYYY-mm-dd format}
\item{YEAR}{The year (YYYY)}
\item{MONTH}{The month (mm)}
\item{DAY}{The day (dd)}
\item{YDAY}{Sequential day of year (not in original GSOD)}
\item{TEMP}{Mean daily temperature converted to degrees C to tenths.
Missing = NA}
\item{TEMP_CNT}{Number of observations used in calculating mean daily
temperature}
\item{DEWP}{Mean daily dew point converted to degrees C to tenths. Missing
= NA}
\item{DEWP_CNT}{Number of observations used in calculating mean daily dew
point}
\item{SLP}{Mean sea level pressure in millibars to tenths. Missing = NA}
\item{SLP_CNT}{Number of observations used in calculating mean sea level
pressure}
\item{STP}{Mean station pressure for the day in millibars to tenths.
Missing = NA}
\item{STP_CNT}{Number of observations used in calculating mean station
pressure}
\item{VISIB}{Mean visibility for the day converted to kilometres to
tenths Missing = NA}
\item{VISIB_CNT}{Number of observations used in calculating mean daily
visibility}
\item{WDSP}{Mean daily wind speed value converted to metres/second to
tenths Missing = NA}
\item{WDSP_CNT}{Number of observations used in calculating mean daily
wind speed}
\item{MXSPD}{Maximum sustained wind speed reported for the day converted
to metres/second to tenths. Missing = NA}
\item{GUST}{Maximum wind gust reported for the day converted to
metres/second to tenths. Missing = NA}
\item{MAX}{Maximum temperature reported during the day converted to
Celsius to tenths--time of max temp report varies by country and region,
so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing =
NA}
\item{MAX_FLAG}{Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit max
temp report and not from the 'hourly' data. An "*" indicates max temp was
derived from the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or synoptic-reported
temperature)}
\item{MIN}{Minimum temperature reported during the day converted to
Celsius to tenths--time of min temp report varies by country and region,
so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing =
NA}
\item{MIN_FLAG}{Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit max
temp report and not from the 'hourly' data. An "*" indicates min temp was
derived from the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or synoptic-reported
temperature)}
\item{PRCP}{Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow) reported during
the day converted to millimetres to hundredths; will usually not end
with the midnight observation, i.e., may include latter part of previous
day. A ".00" value indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace).
Missing = NA; *Note: Many stations do not report '0' on days with no
precipitation-- therefore, 'NA' will often appear on these days. For
example, a station may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during
which rain fell.* See FLAGS_PRCP column for source of data}
\item{PRCP_FLAG}{
  \describe{
   \item{A}{1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount}
   \item{B}{Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount}

   \item{F}{Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount}
   \item{G}{1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount}
   \item{H}{Station reported '0' as the amount for the day (e.g., from
   6-hour reports), but also reported at least one occurrence of
   precipitation in hourly observations--this could indicate a trace
   occurred, but should be considered as incomplete data for the day}
   \item{I}{Station did not report any precip data for the day and did not
   report any occurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations--it's
   still possible that precipitation occurred but was not reported}
