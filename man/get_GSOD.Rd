  filename = NULL, max_missing = NULL, agroclimatology = FALSE,
  CSV = FALSE, GPKG = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{Year(s) of weather data to download.}

\item{station}{Optional. Specify a station or multiple stations for which to
retrieve, check and clean weather data using \code{STNID}. The NCEI reports
years for which the data are available. This function checks against these
years. However, not all cases are properly documented and in some cases files
may not exist on the ftp server even though it is indicated that data was
recorded for the station for a particular year. If a station is specified
that does not have an existing file on the server, this function will
silently fail and move on to existing files for download and cleaning from
the FTP server.}

\item{country}{Optional. Specify a country for which to retrieve weather
data; full name or ISO codes can be used. See
\code{\link{country_list}} for a full list of country names and ISO
codes available.}

\item{dsn}{Optional. Local file path to write file out to. Must be specified
if CSV or GPKG parameters are selected. If unspecified and \code{CSV} or
\code{GPKG} are set to TRUE, \code{dsn} will default to the current working
directory.}

\item{filename}{Optional. The filename for resulting file(s) to be written
with no file extension. File extension will be automatically appended to file
outputs. If unspecified by the user it will default to "GSOD" followed by
the file extension(s) set using \code{CSV} or \code{GPKG}.}

\item{max_missing}{Optional. The maximum number of days allowed to be missing
from a station's data before it is excluded from final file output.}

\item{agroclimatology}{Optional. Logical. Only clean data for stations
between latitudes 60 and -60 for agroclimatology work, defaults to FALSE.
Set to TRUE to include only stations within the confines of these
latitudes.}

\item{CSV}{Optional. Logical. If set to TRUE, create a comma separated value
(CSV) file and save it locally in a user specified location, if \code{dsn} is
not specified by the user, defaults to the current working directory.}

\item{GPKG}{Optional. Logical. If set to TRUE, create a GeoPackage file and
save it locally in a user specified location, if \code{dsn} is not specified
by the user, defaults to the current working directory.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} object of weather data or a
comma-separated value (CSV) or GeoPackage (GPKG) file saved to local disk.

\description{
This function automates downloading, cleaning, reformatting of data from
the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) data provided by the US National
Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI),
\url{https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod},
and elements three new variables; saturation vapour pressure (es) â€“ Actual
vapour pressure (ea) and relative humidity (RH).  Stations reporting a latitude
of < -90 or > 90 or longitude of < -180 or > 180 are removed.  Stations may be
individually checked for number of missing days to assure data quality and
omitting stations with too many missing observations.  All units are converted
to International System of Units (SI), e.g., Fahrenheit to Celsius and inches
to millimetres.  Alternative elevation measurements are supplied for missing
values or values found to be questionable based on the Consultative Group for
International Agricultural Research's Consortium for Spatial Information
group's (CGIAR-CSI) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 90 metre (SRTM 90m)
digital elevation data based on NASA's original SRTM 90m data.  Further
information on these data and methods can be found on GSODR's GitHub
repository here:
\url{https://github.com/ropensci/GSODR/blob/master/data-raw/fetch_isd-history.md}.

\details{
Data summarise each year by station, which include vapour pressure and
relative humidity elements calculated from existing data in GSOD.

If the option to save locally is selected. Output may be saved as comma-
separated, CSV, files or GeoPackage, GPKG, files in a directory specified by
the user, defaulting to the current working directory.

When querying selected stations and electing to write files to disk, all
years queried and stations queried will be merged into one final output file.

All missing values in resulting files are represented as NA regardless of
which field they occur in.

For more information see the description of the data provided by NCEI,
\url{http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/GSOD_DESC.txt}.

The data returned either in a data.frame object and/or a file written to
local disk that includes the following fields:
\describe{
\item{STNID}{Station number (WMO/DATSAV3 number) for the location}
\item{WBAN}{Number where applicable--this is the historical "Weather Bureau
Air Force Navy" number - with WBAN being the acronym}

temp report and not from the 'hourly' data. An "*" indicates max temp was
derived from the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or synoptic-reported

the day converted to millimetres to hundredths; will usually not end
with the midnight observation, i.e., may include latter part of previous
day. A ".00" value indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace).
Missing = NA; *Note: Many stations do not report '0' on days with no
precipitation-- therefore, 'NA' will often appear on these days. For
example, a station may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during
which rain fell.* See FLAGS_PRCP column for source of data}

   occurred, but should be considered as incomplete data for the day}
   \item{I}{Station did not report any precip data for the day and did not
   report any occurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations--it's
   still possible that precipitation occurred but was not reported}
