# Creating Spatial Files

Because the stations provide geospatial location information, it is possible to
create a spatial file. [GeoPackage files](http://www.geopackage.org) are a open,
standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing compact
format for transferring geospatial information, which handle vector files much
like shapefiles do, but eliminate many of the issues that shapefiles have with
field names and the number of files.

## Converting to an _sf_ object

Simple features are an ISO defined standard that now have support in R. From the
[_sf_ vignette](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html):

> Simple features or simple feature access refers to a formal standard (ISO
19125-1:2004) that describes how objects in the real world can be represented in
computers, with emphasis on the spatial geometry of these objects. It also
describes how such objects can be stored in and retrieved from databases, and
which geometrical operations should be defined for them.
The standard is widely implemented in spatial databases (such as PostGIS),
commercial GIS (e.g., ESRI ArcGIS) and forms the vector data basis for libraries
such as GDAL. A subset of simple features forms the GeoJSON standard.

For this example, we convert the GSOD data for Australia in 2017 to an _sf_
object.

```{r spatial_Ex1, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(GSODR)
library(future)
library(sf)

plan("multisession")
GSOD <- get_GSOD(years = 2017, country = "AUS")

GSOD_SF <- st_as_sf(x = GSOD,
                    coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"),
                    crs = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")

str(GSOD_SF)
```

## Saving _sf_ objects

Writing a shapefile is a simple matter.

```{r Ex5, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
write_sf(obj = GSOD_SF, dsn = file.path(tempdir(), "GSOD.shp"))
```

As is writing a GeoPackage from the _sf_ object.

```{r Ex7, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
write_sf(obj = GSOD_SF, dsn = file.path(tempdir(), "GSOD.gpkg"))
```

After getting weather stations for Australia and creating a GeoPackage file,
_sf_ can import the data into R again in a spatial format.

```{r Ex8, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(rgdal)

AUS_stations <-
  st_read(dsn = file.path(tempdir(), "GSOD.gpkg"), layer = "GSOD")

class(AUS_stations)
```

Since GeoPackage files are formatted as SQLite databases you can also use other
R tools for SQLite files
[(J. Stachelek 2016)](https://jsta.github.io/2016/07/14/geopackage-r.html). One
easy way is using _dplyr_. This option is much faster to load since it does not
load the geometry.

```{r Ex, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
AUS_sqlite <- tbl(src_sqlite(file.path(tempdir(), "GSOD.gpkg")), "GSOD")
class(AUS_sqlite)
```
