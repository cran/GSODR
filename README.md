## Introduction

The GSOD or
[Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod)
data provided by the US National Centers for Environmental Information
(NCEI) are a valuable source of weather data with global coverage.
However, the data files are cumbersome and difficult to work with.
_GSODR_ aims to make it easy to find, transfer and format the data you
need for use in analysis and provides five main functions for
facilitating this:

- `get_GSOD()` - this function queries and transfers files from the NCEI's
FTP server, reformats them and returns a tidy data frame in R. **NOTE** If you 
have used file exporting capabilities in versions prior to 1.2.0, these have
been removed now in the latest version. This means less dependencies when
installing. Examples of how to export the data are found in the GSODR vignette.

- `reformat_GSOD()` - this function takes individual station files from the
local disk and re-formats them returning a tidy data frame in R

- `nearest_stations()` - this function returns a vector of station IDs that fall
within the given radius (kilometres) of a point given as latitude and longitude

- `update_station_list()` - this function downloads the latest station list from
the NCEI's FTP server updates the package's internal database of stations and
their metadata.

- `get_inventory()` - this function downloads the latest station inventory
information from the NCEI's FTP server and returns the header information about
the latest version as a message in the console and a tidy data frame of the
stations' inventory for each month that data are reported.

When reformatting data either with `get_GSOD()` or `reformat_GSOD()`, all units
are converted to International System of Units (SI), _e.g._, inches to
millimetres and Fahrenheit to Celsius. File output is returned as a `tibble()`,
summarising each year by station, which also includes vapour pressure and
relative humidity elements calculated from existing data in GSOD. Additional
data are calculated by this R package using the original data and included in
the final data. These include vapour pressure (ea and es) and relative humidity.

It is recommended that you have a good Internet connection to download the data
files as they can be quite large and slow to download.

For more information see the description of the data provided by NCEI,
<http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/GSOD_DESC.txt>.

## Quick Start Install

### Stable Version

A stable version of _GSODR_ is available from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GSODR).

```r
install.packages("GSODR")
```

### Development Version

A development version is available from from GitHub. If you wish to install the
development version that may have new features or bug fixes before the CRAN
version does (but also may not work properly), please install the
[remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) package, available from CRAN.
We strive to keep the master branch on GitHub functional and working properly.

```r
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")
  library("remotes")
}

install_github("ropensci/GSODR")
```

## Other Sources of Weather Data in R

There are several other sources of weather data and ways of retrieving them
through R. Several are also [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) projects.

[_rnoaa_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnoaa), from
[rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) offers tools for interacting with and
downloading weather data from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration but lacks support for GSOD data.

[_bomrang_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bomrang), from
[rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) provides functions to interface with Australia
Government Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) data, fetching data and returning a tidy
data frame of précis forecasts, current weather data from stations, agriculture
bulletin data, BoM 0900 or 1500 weather bulletins or a raster stack object of
satellite imagery from GeoTIFF files. Data (c) Australian Government Bureau of
Meteorology Creative Commons (CC) Attribution 3.0 licence or Public Access
Licence (PAL) as appropriate. See <http://www.bom.gov.au/other/copyright.shtml>
for further details.

[_riem_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=riem) from
[rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) allows to get weather data from Automated
Surface Observing System (ASOS) stations (airports) in the whole world thanks to
the Iowa Environment Mesonet website.

[_CliFlo_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clifro) from
[rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) is a web portal to the New Zealand National
Climate Database and provides public access (via subscription) to around 6,500
various climate stations (see <https://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/> for more
information). Collating and manipulating data from CliFlo (hence clifro) and
importing into R for further analysis, exploration and visualisation is now
straightforward and coherent. The user is required to have an internet
connection, and a current CliFlo subscription (free) if data from stations,
other than the public Reefton electronic weather station, is sought.

[_weatherData_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=weatherData) provides a
selection of functions to fetch weather data from Weather Underground and return
it as a clean data frame. 

## Other Sources for Fetching GSOD Weather Data

The
[_GSODTools_](https://github.com/environmentalinformatics-marburg/GSODTools)
by [Florian Detsch](https://github.com/fdetsch) is an R package that
offers similar functionality as _GSODR_, but also has the ability to
graph the data and working with data for time series analysis.

The [_ULMO_](https://github.com/ulmo-dev/ulmo) library offers an
interface to retrieve GSOD data using Python.

## Notes

### Other Data Sources

#### Elevation Values

90m hole-filled SRTM digital elevation (Jarvis _et al._ 2008) was used
to identify and correct/remove elevation errors in data for station
locations between -60˚ and 60˚ latitude. This applies to cases here
where elevation was missing in the reported values as well. In case the
station reported an elevation and the DEM does not, the station reported
is taken. For stations beyond -60˚ and 60˚ latitude, the values are
station reported values in every instance. See
<https://github.com/ropensci/GSODR/blob/master/data-raw/fetch_isd-history.md>
for more detail on the correction methods.

### WMO Resolution 40. NOAA Policy

_Users of these data should take into account the following (from the [NCEI website](http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/cdoselect.cmd?datasetabbv=GSOD&countryabbv=&georegionabbv=)):_

> "The following data and products may have conditions placed on their

> non-commercial international activities without restriction. The
> non-U.S. data cannot be redistributed for commercial purposes.
> Re-distribution of these data by others must provide this same
> notification."
